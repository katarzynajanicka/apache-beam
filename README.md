Apache Beam Katas exercises -> https://beam.apache.org/blog/beam-kata-release/

Beam Katas objective is to provide a series of structured hands-on learning experiences for learners to understand about Apache Beam and its SDKs by solving exercises with gradually increasing complexity. It is built based on JetBrains Educational Products. Beam Katas is available for both Java and Python SDKs. Currently we have about 20 lessons that cover Apache Beam fundamentals, such as core transforms, common transforms, and simple use case (word count), with more katas to be added in the coming future.
